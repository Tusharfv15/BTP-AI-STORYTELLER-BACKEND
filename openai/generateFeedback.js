The data includes a detailed narrative (the story), a series of questions related to the story, the correct answers to each question, and the user’s responses, which have been converted from spoken responses to text. For each question, compare the user’s answer with the correct answer, focusing on how accurately, relevantly, and clearly the user has addressed the question. Please provide feedback on how well the user's response aligns with the correct answer, noting any areas where understanding, clarity, or detail could be improved. Suggest specific adjustments or corrections if needed to help the user refine their responses.
For each question, provide:
1. A rating out of 5 based on how accurately the user's answer shows understanding of the story.
2. Constructive feedback that helps the child improve their comprehension skills. Highlight key areas they might have missed, offer gentle guidance on how to connect details in the story, and encourage them to think about the story’s main ideas and themes.
3. Positive reinforcement to keep the child motivated and help them enjoy the process of learning to read with understanding.
